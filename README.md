# Portfolio

In this repository you will find some projects of my python coding portfolio. 

1) Data Visualization (Jupyter Notebook)

* Basic work with data (here Gapminder datasets)
    - import files (csv, xlxs - using Pandas)
    - manipulation of dataframes (using Pandas)
    - removing NaN values (Pandas)

* Data visualization: 
    - Scatter plot of correlation between fertility rate and life expectancy compared between countries (matplotlib, seaborn)
    - Animation of the scatterplot depending on the year (matplotlib, seaborn, imageio)
    - Creating for loops 
    -Data visualization with slider to select the depicted year (plotly)

2) Virtual Assistant for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis

Virtual assistant comprises two programs. First is patient metric based diagnosis prediction using logistic regression model. Second is MRI image classification with convolutional neuronal network (CNN). 

You can find the data exploration and model training in the Building models folder, and the front-end app development in Streamlit app foler. 

Key tools used within this project:
* Pandas for data exploration and user input formating 
* Matplotlip, Seaborn, Plotly for data visualization 
* Sklearn Logistic regression model for diagnosis predictions 
* TensorFlow/Keras for building convolutional neuronal network for image classifier 
* Streamlit for front-end app developemnt
